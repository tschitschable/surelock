Surelock is a password manager that saves encrypted passwords in a database.

If you open Surelock for the first time you need to create a new database for your passwords.
Choose a filename and a strong password and click Create. Click ==Reset== if you want to clear the entries.
After creating a database it is automatically opened in the main window (see Main Window). 

If you want to open an existing database choose the file with `Browse`, enter the password and click "Open" to proceed to the main window. 
Clicking "Set as default database" sets the selected database as the default database. It will be selected automatically the next time surelock is opened.

To access the password generator, click "Password Generator". 

### Password Generator

The password generator generates strong passwords based on a simple character sequence. The user only has to remember a simple character sequence and the length of the password (and whether it contains numbers and special characters) to access it.

Type a simple easy to remember character sequence into the field "Simple Password", use the slider to specify the length of the password you want to generate and click "Generate Password", to generate a password made of letters (upper case and lower case).
If you check "Include special characters"/ "Include numbers" the password generator will include at least one special character/ number in the generated password.
Clicking "Copy to Clipboard" copies the password to the clipboard and replaces it with ***** on the screen.


### Main Window

On the left you see a list of all categories and the number of passwords saved in each category in brackets. Click on a category to select it. The selected category will be highlighted in blue. 
The table on the right shows the site (e.g. "google" or "google.com"), the username and the description for each password in the selected category. 

After creating a database, it contains the default category root. To add another category, click "Add Category" and enter its name. Clicking "Delete Category" deletes the selected category.
 
To add an entry to the selected category, click "Add Entry" (for further information see "Adding a new Entry"). 

Click on an entry to select it (highlighted blue). After selecting an entry, you can delete it with "Delete Entry", show its password with "Show Password" or copy its password to the clipboard with "Copy Password to Clipboard".
"Clear Clipboard" clears the clipboard. 

"Open/Create Database" in the "File"-Menu opens the first window.
